# CLIProxyAPI gateway sidecar for 0.9.1 (download binary plus GUI, Windows-first)

## Goal

Ship a Windows-first CLIProxyAPI (CPA) gateway integration in 0.9.1 so a user can download the official `cli-proxy-api.exe`, log in a Codex subscription via `--codex-login`, keep the gateway running on `127.0.0.1:8317`, and consume it from Janus chat plus external Codex CLI through per-terminal provider entries. No shared credential pool: each terminal keeps its own `llm-config.json` collection and only stores the local gateway key, never the OAuth token. No TypeScript reimplementation of CPA translators.

## Scope

P0 Windows spike (time-boxed, no UI): manually download the official Windows amd64/arm64 release, verify `checksums.txt` SHA-256, run `cli-proxy-api.exe -config config.yaml --codex-login` with browser callback on port `1455`, fall back to `--no-browser` and `-codex-device-login` when the callback is occupied, then start the daemon and prove `POST http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/chat/completions` plus `GET /v1/models` answer with a Codex OAuth credential. Record the exact release version, callback ports (`8317/1455/8085/54545`), and failure modes. Abort the task if official login is broken on Windows.

P1 managed binary plus lifecycle: new `src/main/cliproxy/` domain reusing the `external-cli` house patterns (`tool-registry` single table, `CliDetector`-style probe, `CliInstaller`-style busy guard, `SerialQueue` plus atomic write). Responsibilities: per-arch download URL resolution from the official GitHub Release, SHA-256 verification before replace, install into `userData/bin` (never overwrite live `config.yaml` or `auth-dir`), `detect` (not-installed / installed-but-broken / ready plus version via `--version` re-probe), `start/stop/status` with health check against `/v1/models`, port-conflict diagnosis, and quarantine of corrupt downloads. No `npm -g` path; no bundled binary in `electron-builder.yml` for 0.9.1.

P2 config plus login orchestration: generate `userData/janusx/cliproxy/config.yaml` from a minimal template (`host: 127.0.0.1`, `port: 8317`, `management.allow-remote: false`, random local `access.api-keys[0]` and `management.secret-key`, `auth-dir` in `C:/` spelling on Windows). Wrap the three login flows (`--codex-login`, `--codex-login --no-browser`, `-codex-device-login`) with `execa` under UTF-8 PowerShell quoting, stream the device URL/code back to the renderer, never log tokens, back up `config.yaml` before every write (10-file rotation like `ClaudeSettingsApplier`), and refuse `host: ""` binds.

P3 Janus-internal consumption (no sharing): expose the gateway as an ordinary `api-key` provider entry inside each terminal's own collection via the existing `llmService.saveTerminalProvider` path (`src/main/llm/ConfigStore.ts`, `src/main/llm/config-document.ts` unchanged in shape). Provide one-click "write gateway provider into this terminal" per tab (`janus` first, then `codex`/`claude` as needed), each writing `baseURL=http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1`, `apiKey=<local gateway key>`, `modelId=<gateway model alias>` into that terminal only. No pool, no binding map, no cross-terminal reference; editing one terminal never touches another. This extends [the per-terminal collections design](./2026-09-18-terminal-provider-collections--51ac8035.md) without reopening it.

P4 external Codex CLI pointing: extend the existing per-format projectors (`src/main/external-cli/terminal-projectors.ts`) with a `model_providers.cliproxyapi` TOML block writer for `~/.codex/config.toml` (`base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1`, `experimental_bearer_token=<local key>`, `wire_api=responses`), keeping the current `model`-key projector, backup-plus-verify, and rollback semantics. Never write `~/.codex/auth.json`; OAuth stays inside CPA `auth-dir`. Out of scope for 0.9.1: LAN exposure. Multi-provider login flows move to P6 below.

P5 UI plus packaging: Settings gateway card with four states (not-installed / stopped / running / broken), actions (download, start, stop, login-codex, open-management, copy-gateway-key), port status line, and zh-CN/en copy in a new `cliproxy` i18n namespace. IPC chain follows the house pattern (`src/shared/ipc/cliproxy.ts` to `src/main/ipc/cliproxy-handlers.ts` to preload bridge to renderer service). No `extraResources` binary in 0.9.1; on-demand download only. Show the subscription-ToS risk notice before first login. The card keeps an `open-management` fallback (native `http://127.0.0.1:8317/management.html`) for long-tail features without reimplementing them.

P6 full account cards (CPA-Dashboard parity, Janus-native reimplementation, no Python bundle): new `CliProxyAccountsPanel` mounted at the top of the Settings `llm` tab above `CliSyncSection` (general tab keeps only the P5 one-line health row). Visual and interaction parity with `dongshuyan/CPA-Dashboard` account page, rebuilt in React with Janus tokens plus the `cliproxy` i18n namespace — never an iframe or bundled `app.py`. Sections: (a) service control row (start/stop/restart, PID plus service dir plus log path, log view with auto-refresh plus clear); (b) stats overview (total plus per-type plus ULTRA/PRO plus needs-relogin counts); (c) account card grid, one card per credential from `GET /v0/management/auth-files` (local `auth-dir` JSON read as offline fallback): email, provider tag (Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Codex, Claude, Qwen, iFlow, Kimi), membership (ULTRA/PRO/FREE), status (active versus needs-relogin), quota bar plus reset countdown where the provider exposes realtime quota (Antigravity) else the static model list synced with CPA `model_definitions_static_data.go`; (d) per-card actions (refresh-quota, delete with confirm, Codex refresh additionally probes Models API and marks needs-relogin on 401); (e) top-level actions (refresh-all with 1-32 concurrency default 4 plus persisted quota cache, add-account OAuth wizard covering all 7 providers with callback ports `51121/8085/1455/54545/55998` plus device-code for Qwen/Kimi, batch-delete needs-relogin with double confirm); (f) type filter (all plus 7 providers plus ULTRA/PRO) combined with needs-relogin-only toggle; (g) connection info block (Base URL, local gateway key count, copyable cURL/Python/OpenAI-SDK examples). Data path is main-side only: Management API with `Bearer <management-key>` over `127.0.0.1` (`/auth-files`, quota switches, `/reset-quota`, `/logs`, `/api-call`), `SerialQueue` plus quota-cache atomic write, tokens never reach logs or renderer state beyond display-masked email. Full login coverage (all 7 OAuth flows) lands here, not in P2.

Non-goals for 0.9.1: bundling the exe into the installer, TS port of Codex/Claude translators, `allow-remote:true`, auto-update of the sidecar, Linux/macOS packaging sign-off (code must not break them, but verification is Windows-first plus typecheck).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC-1: On Windows, official binary plus `--codex-login` (or device fallback) yields a working gateway; `/v1/models` and one `/v1/chat/completions` call succeed through the Codex subscription with no manual YAML editing beyond the generated template.
- [ ] AC-2: Download path verifies SHA-256 before replace, never overwrites `config.yaml` or `auth-dir`, serializes concurrent installs, and re-probes before reporting success; corrupt download fails closed with no half-written binary.
- [ ] AC-3: Gateway binds `127.0.0.1:8317` only, management is localhost-only with a required key, tokens never appear in logs or renderer state, and every `config.yaml` write keeps a restorable backup.
- [ ] AC-4: No shared pool is introduced: gateway credentials reach terminals only as independent per-terminal `api-key` entries; deleting or editing one terminal leaves the others untouched, and `janus` internal features keep resolving the `janus` collection.
- [ ] AC-5: External Codex CLI can be pointed at the gateway through the projector with backup plus verify plus rollback, without touching `auth.json`; rollback restores the newest backup and refuses loudly when none exists.
- [ ] AC-6: UI shows the four gateway states with working download/start/stop/login actions, port-conflict and broken-binary diagnostics, zh-CN/en copy, and the ToS notice; `npm run typecheck`, unit suites, and `npm run i18n:check` stay green.
- [ ] AC-7: Settings `llm` tab shows the full account grid with CPA-Dashboard parity (service row, stats, per-card email plus provider plus membership plus status plus quota-or-static-list, refresh plus delete, refresh-all concurrency, 7-provider add wizard, type plus needs-relogin filters, batch-delete-invalid with confirm, connection examples); no Python runtime, no iframe, Janus tokens plus `cliproxy` namespace.
- [ ] AC-8: Quota path is main-side only with cache plus concurrency 1-32 default 4, Codex 401 marks needs-relogin, offline falls back to `auth-dir` JSON read, management key stays localhost-only and out of logs/renderer secrets.

## Verification

- `npm run typecheck` (V-1, required).
- `npx vitest run tests/unit/cliproxy` (new: download-verify, config-template, port-conflict, provider-writer, projector-block, auth-files-parse, quota-cache-concurrency, card-filter suites; network and OAuth flows mocked, no live subscription in unit).
- `npx vitest run tests/unit/external-cli tests/unit/llm` (regression: terminal collections and projectors untouched in shape).
- `npm run i18n:check` (new `cliproxy` namespace in sync).
- Manual Windows-only: official exe download, `--codex-login` plus device fallback, daemon start, Janus chat call through the gateway provider, `codex CLI` call through `model_providers.cliproxyapi`, stop plus rollback; record release version and ports in Results. No live credentials in the repo.

## Alternatives considered

- Bundle the exe in `electron-builder.yml extraResources` like `resources/officecli` — strongest case is offline install with zero download code. The driver that rules it out for 0.9.1 is payload and cadence: per-arch tens of MB plus CPA release churn plus signing review; on-demand download keeps the installer lean, with bundling as the revisit.
- Reimplement Codex OAuth plus translators in TypeScript — strongest case is zero binary and full control. The driver that rules it out is maintenance: Codex cloaking, Claude betas, and quota semantics track upstream constantly; the sidecar buys all of it for one process-supervision module.
- Point every terminal at one shared gateway provider record — strongest case is single-copy secret. The driver that rules it out is the adopted [per-terminal collections decision](./2026-09-18-terminal-provider-collections--51ac8035.md): independent `{providers, defaultId}` per terminal with one-time copy, never references; sharing reopens sprawl and cross-terminal delete propagation.
- Depend on an external EasyCLIProxyAPI install only — strongest case is zero Janus code beyond docs. The driver that rules it out is UX: detection plus guided install stays, but login, daemon supervision, and one-click provider wiring are the 0.9.1 value; external-only remains the fallback when the managed download is unavailable.
- Bundle or iframe CPA-Dashboard (`dongshuyan/CPA-Dashboard` Flask `app.py` on `:5000`) — strongest case is instant full cards with zero React work. The driver that rules it out is stack and trust cost: extra Python venv plus pip plus second supervised port, theme plus i18n plus ToS-gate mismatch, management key in browser localStorage reversible-obfuscation instead of Electron main-side custody, no one-click write into per-terminal collections, and no published license file for bundling; Dashboard stays the product-pattern reference plus the `open-management` fallback, never a runtime dependency.
- Embed the official `management.html` (`:8317/management.html`) in a webview — strongest case is zero parity drift. The driver that rules it out is the same custody gap (localStorage key, no Janus tokens/i18n, no house backup plus verify patterns); keep it as the linked fallback behind `open-management`.
- Do nothing / keep hand-edited `baseURL=http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1` — costs nothing now. The cost is the gap above: manual binary, YAML, login, daemon, and per-terminal wiring with no safety net on Windows.

## Results

Proposed for 0.9.1; no execution evidence yet. Fill on landing with the CPA release version, Windows verification log, and unit plus typecheck plus i18n results.
