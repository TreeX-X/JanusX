/**
 * @file Deprecated shim over NoteAdapter v1 (V2 readonly refactor)
 * @description All mapping tables moved to `src/main/notes/note-to-blueprint.ts`.
 *  New code must import from `../notes/note-to-blueprint` directly; this module
 *  only keeps existing importers compiling.
 *  See .agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-09-22-blueprint-note-graph-readonly.md
 * @deprecated Use NoteAdapter v1 (`src/main/notes/note-to-blueprint.ts`).
