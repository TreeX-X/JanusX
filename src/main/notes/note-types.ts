/**
 * @file Note boundary types (V2 readonly refactor)

 *  free of harness-core/harness-node imports (not even type-only): the adapter
 *  below must stay usable from a fixture upgrade that touches only
 *  `note-to-blueprint.ts` plus golden snapshots. `note-provider.ts` converts the
 *  parsed representation into these shapes at the boundary.
